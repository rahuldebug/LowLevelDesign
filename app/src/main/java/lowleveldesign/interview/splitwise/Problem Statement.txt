Create a Split wise

Initial discussion and clarification on functionality -->

once done --> Object Identification ::

User -->  String name ,
          id would be telephone number


Expense --> expense can be created for individual transaction between users
String cash between persons  , 2 person . Basically single person owing (split logic would be straight forward )

or

Expense can be created for group
so expense will have name , and map of user and their expense
Group --> will have

,
expense can have different type of split , equal , percentage or many expenditure


map of multiple users and thier expense .


people can call call split controller and update thier expense

this should be only done for multiple contri
else this won't be allowed

notification enfine (Observer) should be created


Expense sheet --> Driving Object , which would have individual users or group , able to add expense or payments

Split--> split controller  , split logic for individual or group (could support % split with validator ) factory pattern

view --> Individual view , every user will have individual view .


More Refinement needs to be done .
